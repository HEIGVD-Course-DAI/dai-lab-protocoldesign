Client-Server Protocol Specification:

1. Protocol:

   - The client and server communicate using a simple text-based protocol over a network connection.

2. Client:

   - The client accepts user input from stdin, specifically mathematical expressions in the form of "OPERATION a b," where "OPERATION" can be "ADD" or "MULTIPLY," and "a" and "b" are numerical values.
   - Example client input: "ADD 10 20"
   - The client sends this input to the server in the following format:
     ```
     REQUEST: "OPERATION a b"
     ```
   - The client waits for the server's response.

3. Server:

   - The server listens on a specified network port for incoming client connections.
   - Upon connection, the server receives the client's request in the form of a text message.
   - The server parses the request to extract the operation type and operands.
   - The server performs the requested operation (addition or multiplication) on the operands.
   - The server sends the result back to the client in the following format:
     ```
     RESPONSE: "RESULT result"
     ```
   - If the client sends an invalid request, the server responds with an error message:
     ```
     RESPONSE: "ERROR Invalid request"
     ```
   - The server continues listening for new client connections after responding.

4. Communication:

   - Both client and server send and receive messages using newline-terminated strings to delimit messages.
   - The server should handle multiple client connections concurrently using threads or other appropriate mechanisms.

Example Interaction:

Client input: "ADD 10 20"
Server response: "RESULT 30"

Client input: "MULTIPLY 5 6"
Server response: "RESULT 30"

Client input: "SUBTRACT 8 3"
Server response: "ERROR Invalid request"

Extensions and Enhancements:

We can extend this basic client-server application with various features, such as error handling, support for additional operations, and the ability to handle more complex expressions.
